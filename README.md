# Context Aware Privacy Platform (CAPP)
With CAPP, we intend to research ways of providing information belonging to an individual to someone else, without the need for large centralized databases, without leaving (traces of) data behind that might make that individual vulnerable.

Without being sure that we will find such a mechanism, we feel inspired, challenged and supported by stuff like this:
- making it intervention driven;
- using a very small scope for proof of concept(s) (such as the emergency room use-case ICE-d);
- basing the exchange of information on conflict detection; 
- Applying a minimal data approach;
- focusing on communication as opposed to registration;
- Using attributes to communicatie the output of the conflict detection; (groen-oranje-rood);
- identifying areas where AI/Fuzzy Logic can be used to ascertain reliability of incomplete data, of provide interpretation of multiple facts;
- Scalability (by focusing on a pull-model vs a push-model.

In plain(er) English: we think that society as a whole is in need for a different model of data-exchange to protect the privacy and security of individuals. Lengthy (and mostly unsuccesful) excercises with Electronic Patient Files and centralized systems to support exchanging relevant (medical) data at the right time have convinced us that we need a different approach.

We think there might be a way to compe up with an approach that:
- is distributed;
- provides only answers to relevant questions with regard to the context of the question;
- does not leave data behind.

During 2016, we will research this, set up meetings of minds to deepen our knowledge and attempt to write a comprehensive Whitepaper on this subject.
