# What is CAPP?
With CAPP, we intend to research ways of providing information belonging to an individual to someone else, without the need for large centralized databases, without leaving (traces of) data behind that might make that individual vulnerable.

---

#Assumptions
- Privacy first;
- Intervention driven;
- Very small scope for proof of concepts;
- Data minimalistic approach;

---

#Assumptions (2)

- Communication of relevant attributes instead of persistent registration of unnecessary data;
- Usage of AI  to ascertain reliability of data;
- Scalable.

---

#Platform

- Open source (license CC);
- Distributed architecture;
- Use cases are based on information supply chain;
- Identifaction;
- Trust of data sources (input / output).

---

#Smart
##Artificial Intelligence
- Inference engine;
- Fuzzy logic to present result (weighed aggregation).

---

#Challenges
##Practical:

- Identifying the subject with (very) high certainty.

##Technical:

- Distributed data storage;
- Protocol specifications.

#Use case
###ICE-d: **I**n **C**ase of **E**mergency **d**ata

---

#What
CAPP can be used to identify conflicts when an intervention (like an MRI) is proposed to a patient.

---

#How
Medical professionals use the platform to request attributes of the patient, identified by their (temporary) ID or token.

---

#Example

  - the doctor is authenticated and authorized to request the data (within a defined scope);
  - the patient can identified using a (temporary) id;
  - the request can be 'MRI possible';
  - the result can be simple answers with metadata (age / quality of the source): yes / unclear / no.
